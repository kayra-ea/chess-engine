Chess-engine is an interactive chess interface where the user can play chess against the computer.

## Intelligence
### Minimax and alpha-beta pruning
The computer uses a standard implementation of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The following link provides an explanation for the algorithm and tree pruning. (http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~rosen/161/notes/alphabeta.html).

### Tree Depth
Minimax creates a tree of depth `n=3`.

## GUI and JPanel
The standara java graphics library is used for all drawing, and JPanel/JFrame are used to structure the window.
